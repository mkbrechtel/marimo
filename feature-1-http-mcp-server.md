# Feature 1: HTTP-based MCP Server

**Description**: An MCP server that runs alongside marimo's existing web interface, exposing notebook operations through the standard MCP protocol over HTTP/WebSocket.

## User Stories

- As a developer using Claude Desktop, I want to create and edit marimo notebooks through natural language commands without switching between applications
- As a data scientist, I want my AI assistant to iterate on visualizations in my notebook while I provide high-level feedback
- As a team lead, I want to use AI tools to automatically generate documentation notebooks from our codebase

## What's Needed

- MCP server implementation that integrates with marimo's existing ASGI application
- Authentication mechanism to secure MCP endpoints
- Resource and tool definitions for notebook operations
- Configuration options in marimo's settings for enabling/disabling MCP
