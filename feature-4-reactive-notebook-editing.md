# Feature 4: Reactive Notebook Editing

**Description**: MCP tools for editing and interacting with marimo notebooks while maintaining reactive execution consistency and understanding cell dependencies.

## User Stories

- As a notebook user, I want AI-generated code to automatically trigger downstream cell updates just like manual edits
- As a developer, I want the AI to understand cell dependencies when suggesting code modifications
- As a data analyst, I want AI assistants to optimize my notebook's execution flow based on the dependency graph
- As a data scientist, I want AI to add exploratory analysis cells based on my dataset's characteristics
- As a developer, I want to refactor notebook code with AI assistance while maintaining cell relationships
- As an analyst, I want AI to insert visualization cells that automatically use upstream data variables
- As a team member, I want AI tools to inspect variable state and suggest optimizations

## What's Needed

### Reactive Execution Awareness
- Expose marimo's dependency graph through MCP tools
- Execution planning tools that preview what cells will run
- Options for synchronous vs asynchronous execution control
- Clear feedback about reactive execution state

### Cell-Level Operations
- Cell addressing system compatible with marimo's architecture
- Tools for cell manipulation with reactive awareness (create, modify, delete, move)
- Output capture and streaming for AI analysis
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Intelligence Features
- Dependency analysis for safe code modifications
- Variable state inspection across cells
- Automatic detection of circular dependencies
- Smart cell insertion that maintains dataflow integrity
- Execution optimization suggestions based on dependency graph
