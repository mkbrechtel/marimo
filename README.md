# Project Proposal: Native MCP Support for marimo

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the integration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) support directly into marimo, enabling AI assistants and external tools to programmatically control marimo notebooks. By implementing both an HTTP-based MCP server (leveraging marimo's existing ASGI infrastructure) and a CLI-based MCP interface, we will unlock powerful AI-assisted workflows while maintaining marimo's core reactive principles.

**ASGI Context**: ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is Python's standard for asynchronous web applications. marimo already uses ASGI to serve notebooks as web applications, making it a natural foundation for adding MCP server capabilities without introducing new dependencies.

## Project Goals

1. Enable AI assistants (Claude, GPT, etc.) to create, modify, and execute marimo notebooks programmatically
2. Provide seamless integration for both interactive (HTTP server) and batch (CLI) workflows
3. Maintain marimo's reactive execution model while exposing it to external control
4. Position marimo as the first reactive notebook platform with native MCP support

## Core Features

### Feature 1: HTTP-based MCP Server

**Description**: An MCP server that runs alongside marimo's existing web interface, exposing notebook operations through the standard MCP protocol over HTTP/WebSocket.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer using Claude Desktop, I want to create and edit marimo notebooks through natural language commands without switching between applications
- As a data scientist, I want my AI assistant to iterate on visualizations in my notebook while I provide high-level feedback
- As a team lead, I want to use AI tools to automatically generate documentation notebooks from our codebase

**What's Needed**:
- MCP server implementation that integrates with marimo's existing ASGI application
- Authentication mechanism to secure MCP endpoints
- Resource and tool definitions for notebook operations
- Configuration options in marimo's settings for enabling/disabling MCP

### Feature 2: CLI MCP Interface

**Description**: A new `marimo mcp` command that enables headless MCP operations, perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows.

**User Stories**:
- As a DevOps engineer, I want to integrate marimo notebook generation into our CI/CD pipeline using AI-driven code analysis
- As a researcher, I want to batch-process multiple datasets through a notebook template using AI to adapt the analysis for each dataset
- As an educator, I want to automatically generate personalized tutorial notebooks for students based on their progress

**What's Needed**:
- New CLI command structure: `marimo mcp [subcommands]`
- Support for both server mode (`marimo mcp serve`) and single-operation mode (`marimo mcp execute`)
- JSON-RPC communication interface for stdin/stdout
- Integration with existing marimo CLI architecture

### Feature 3: Reactive Execution Awareness

**Description**: MCP tools that understand and work with marimo's reactive execution model, ensuring external modifications maintain notebook consistency.

**User Stories**:
- As a notebook user, I want AI-generated code to automatically trigger downstream cell updates just like manual edits
- As a developer, I want the AI to understand cell dependencies when suggesting code modifications
- As a data analyst, I want AI assistants to optimize my notebook's execution flow based on the dependency graph

**What's Needed**:
- Expose marimo's dependency graph through MCP tools
- Execution planning tools that preview what cells will run
- Options for synchronous vs asynchronous execution control
- Clear feedback about reactive execution state

### Feature 4: Notebook Management Tools

**Description**: Comprehensive MCP tools for creating, loading, saving, and managing marimo notebooks.

**User Stories**:
- As a project manager, I want to use AI to generate project status notebooks from multiple data sources
- As a developer, I want to version control AI-assisted notebook modifications with clear change tracking
- As a team member, I want to share notebook templates that AI assistants can customize for different use cases

**What's Needed**:
- Tools for notebook CRUD operations
- Template system integration
- Metadata management for AI-generated content
- Git-friendly change tracking for AI modifications

### Feature 5: Cell-Level Operations

**Description**: Fine-grained MCP tools for manipulating individual cells, including creation, modification, execution, and deletion.

**User Stories**:
- As a data scientist, I want AI to add exploratory analysis cells based on my dataset's characteristics
- As a developer, I want to refactor notebook code with AI assistance while maintaining cell relationships
- As an analyst, I want AI to insert visualization cells that automatically use upstream data variables

**What's Needed**:
- Cell addressing system compatible with marimo's architecture
- Tools for cell manipulation with reactive awareness
- Output capture and streaming for AI analysis
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Feature 6: Session and Kernel Management

**Description**: MCP tools for managing marimo kernel sessions, including restart, interrupt, and state inspection capabilities.

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want AI assistants to automatically restart the kernel when they detect inconsistent state
- As a researcher, I want to save and restore notebook sessions through AI commands
- As a team member, I want AI tools to inspect variable state and suggest optimizations

**What's Needed**:
- Kernel lifecycle management tools
- State inspection and serialization capabilities
- Resource monitoring and limits
- Multi-session support for parallel AI operations

## Integration Benefits

1. **Developer Experience**: Seamless AI assistance without leaving the marimo environment
2. **Ecosystem Growth**: First reactive notebook with native MCP support
3. **Enterprise Ready**: Secure, auditable AI-notebook interactions
4. **Community Innovation**: Enable new AI-powered notebook workflows

## Technical Considerations

- Leverage existing ASGI infrastructure to minimize new dependencies
- Maintain backward compatibility with current marimo APIs
- Design for extensibility to support future MCP specification updates
- Ensure security through proper authentication and authorization
- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples

## Success Criteria

1. Full MCP protocol compliance for all implemented features
2. No performance degradation for non-MCP notebook usage
3. Successful integration with major AI platforms (Claude Desktop, Continue, etc.)
4. Positive community feedback and adoption
5. Clear documentation enabling third-party tool development

## Next Steps

1. Community RFC to gather feedback on proposed features
2. Prototype implementation of core MCP server
3. Integration with marimo's existing test suite
4. Documentation and example creation
5. Beta testing with selected community members
6. Pull request submission with comprehensive testing

This native MCP integration will position marimo as the leading AI-native notebook platform, enabling workflows that aren't possible with traditional notebooks while maintaining the reactive execution model that makes marimo unique.
