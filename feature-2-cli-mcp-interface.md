# Feature 2: CLI MCP Interface

**Description**: A new `marimo mcp` command that enables headless MCP operations, perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows.

## User Stories

- As a DevOps engineer, I want to integrate marimo notebook generation into our CI/CD pipeline using AI-driven code analysis
- As a researcher, I want to batch-process multiple datasets through a notebook template using AI to adapt the analysis for each dataset
- As an educator, I want to automatically generate personalized tutorial notebooks for students based on their progress

## What's Needed

- New CLI command structure: `marimo mcp [subcommands]`
- Support for both server mode (`marimo mcp serve`) and single-operation mode (`marimo mcp execute`)
- JSON-RPC communication interface for stdin/stdout
- Integration with existing marimo CLI architecture
